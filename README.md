# Spatial Web Orchestration
Welcome to the IXO Spatial Web Orchestration repository! 
Let's start with an overview of orchestration concepts within the context of the IXO Spatial Web by emphasizing the importance of Object Capabilities and secure computation. 

## What is the Spatial Web?

The IXO [Spatial Web](https://vision.hipeac.net/the-next-computing-paradigm-ncp--the-spatial-web.html) Platform uses Web 3.0, AI, and multi-dimentional mapping in ways that seamlessly integrate the physical and digital realms. This enables us to create and operate Digital Twin systems that can represent physical-world properties, as well as cognitive systems that are intangible, such as Projects.

Traditional web experiences that exist primarily on flat screens and Internet protocols generally route information between servers, through IP domain addressing. In contrast, the Spatial Web creates multi-dimensional domains, using cryptographically authenticated digital identifiers (DIDs) to address and interact with people, places, and things. 

By mapping digital information spatially onto real-world objects and locations, the Spatial Web enhances user experiences and fosters new forms of engagement, paving the way for smarter cities, immersive experiences, and interconnected systems that redefine how we live and work. This has the potential to [unlock tranformative impacts](https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/unlocking-reality-spatial-web-transformative-impact/).

## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration refers to the automated management and coordination of complex processes across various systems and services. In the context of the IXO Spatial Web, orchestration is designed to achieve **highly secure computation** by enabling seamless interactions between diverse entities, including human agents, organisations, IoT devices, AI systems, and blockchain networks. This capability is essential for creating a cohesive environment where data and services can be accessed and utilized efficiently while maintaining stringent security protocols.

### Importance of Object Capabilities

Object capabilities are a fundamental aspect of secure orchestration. They provide a mechanism for granting permissions to specific actions or resources without exposing unnecessary access rights. This principle enhances security by ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with sensitive components, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or manipulation.

In the IXO Spatial Web, leveraging object capabilities allows for:

- **Granular Access Control**: Permissions can be finely tuned to allow only specific actions on certain objects.
  
- **Enhanced Security**: By restricting access based on capabilities, the system reduces potential attack vectors.

- **Decentralized Trust**: Object capabilities enable trust among disparate systems without requiring centralized control.

## How Orchestration Works with Object Capabilities and zCaps

Orchestration in the IXO Spatial Web implements Object Capabilities, asing mechanisms such as [Agoric Orchestration[](https://docs.agoric.com/guides/orchestration/) and [zCaps](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/) (Authorization Capabilities for Linked-Data) to facilitate secure interactions. The orchestration process involves several key steps:

1. **Invitation Creation**: When a service or resource is made available, an invitation is created that encapsulates the necessary permissions as an object capability.

2. **Capability Granting**: The invitation is then granted to authorized users or systems, allowing them to perform specific actions without exposing broader access rights.

3. **Execution and Monitoring**: Once a capability is accepted, the orchestrated process can execute securely. The system continuously monitors interactions to ensure compliance with security protocols.

4. **Revocation and Management**: Capabilities can be revoked or modified as needed, allowing dynamic management of permissions based on evolving requirements.

### Example Use-Cases for Object Capability-Based Orchestration in IXO

Here are some practical use-cases demonstrating how object capability-based orchestration can be applied within the IXO Spatial Web:

- **Smart City Management**: In a smart city context, various IoT devices (e.g., traffic lights, sensors) can interact securely through orchestrated capabilities. For instance, a traffic management system could adjust signals based on real-time data from multiple sensors while ensuring that only authorized applications can make changes.

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: In DeFi applications, users can interact with multiple financial services across different blockchains using object capabilities. For example, a user could swap assets between chains while maintaining control over their permissions, ensuring that only specific transactions are executed.

- **Autonomous Systems Coordination**: Autonomous vehicles or drones operating within a spatial web environment can utilize orchestration to communicate and coordinate actions securely. By using object capabilities, these systems can share information about their status or location without exposing sensitive operational details.

## Conclusion

The integration of orchestration with object capabilities in the IXO Spatial Web represents a significant advancement towards creating secure, efficient, and interoperable systems. By leveraging these concepts, we can build robust applications that facilitate seamless interactions across diverse environments while maintaining high standards of security and trust.
